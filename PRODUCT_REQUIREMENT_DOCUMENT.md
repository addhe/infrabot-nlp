## 1. Introduction

Infrabot-NLP is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application designed to provide a unified and interactive interface for developers and operations engineers to leverage various Large Language Models (LLMs) for infrastructure-related tasks and general queries. It aims to simplify interactions with AI models by providing a consistent user experience and integrating useful tools for common operational needs.

## System Requirements

### Technical Requirements

- macOS (primary supported platform)
- Linux/Windows (secondary supported platforms)
- 4GB RAM minimum, 8GB recommended
- Internet connectivity for API access

### Dependencies
- Core dependencies listed in requirements.txt
- Development dependencies listed in requirements-dev.txt
- API keys for supported AI providers

## 2. Goals and Objectives

*   **Unified AI Access**: Provide a single CLI to interact with multiple leading AI models (e.g., Google Gemini, OpenAI GPT series, Anthropic Claude).
*   **Task Automation**: Enable users to perform specific tasks like shell command execution, GCP resource management, and time lookups through natural language commands processed by AI.
*   **Enhanced Productivity**: Streamline workflows for developers and SREs by integrating AI assistance directly into their terminal environment.
*   **Extensibility**: Design the system to be easily extensible with new AI models and new tools/capabilities.
*   **User-Friendly CLI**: Offer an intuitive and easy-to-use command-line experience.

## 3. Target Audience

*   **Software Developers**: For quick lookups, code generation/understanding assistance, and simple script execution.
*   **DevOps Engineers / SREs**: For automating infrastructure tasks, querying cloud resources, and troubleshooting.
*   **System Administrators**: For managing systems and executing commands with AI assistance.
*   **AI Enthusiasts**: For exploring and comparing capabilities of different LLMs through a common interface.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1. Core AI Interaction

*   **FR1.1 Multi-Model Support**: The application must support interaction with:
    *   Google Gemini Pro and Gemini Ultra models (via direct API and ADK)
    *   OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-3.5 Turbo models (via direct API)
    *   Anthropic Claude 3 and Claude 2.1 models (via direct API)
*   **FR1.2 Natural Language Input**: Users shall be able to input queries and commands in natural language
*   **FR1.3 AI Response Display**: The application must clearly display responses from the AI model
*   **FR1.4 Model Fallback**: Implement automatic fallback to alternative models if primary model is unavailable

### 4.2. Tool Integration

The application must support the following tools, callable via AI understanding of user intent:

*   **FR2.1 Shell Command Execution:**
    *   **FR2.1.1**: Allow users to request the execution of shell commands on the local system.
    *   **FR2.1.2**: Display the output (stdout, stderr) of the executed commands.
    *   **FR2.1.3**: Implement safety measures or confirmations for potentially destructive commands (Future consideration: User confirmation).
*   **FR2.2 Time Lookup:**
    *   **FR2.2.1**: Allow users to ask for the current time in specified cities or timezones.
*   **FR2.3 GCP Project Management (requires user authentication with GCP):**
    *   **FR2.3.1**: List GCP projects. Users shall be able to list all projects or filter them by environment (e.g., dev, stg, prod) if such tagging/naming conventions are used or if "all" is specified as the environment.
    *   **FR2.3.2**: Create new GCP projects, allowing specification of project ID, name, and organization ID.

### 4.3. Configuration

*   **FR3.1 API Key Management**: Users must be able to configure API keys for the different AI services.
    *   Support for environment variables.
    *   Support for `.env` files.
*   **FR3.2 Model ID Configuration**: Users should be able to specify preferred model IDs for each provider (e.g., `gpt-4-turbo-preview`, `gemini-1.5-pro-latest`).

### 4.4. User Interface (CLI)

*   **FR4.1 Interactive Prompt**: The application shall provide an interactive prompt for user input.
*   **FR4.2 Clear Instructions**: Provide clear instructions on how to start, use, and exit the application.
*   **FR4.3 Exit Command**: A dedicated command (e.g., `exit()`) to terminate the application gracefully.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **NFR1.1 Performance**:
    *   Responses from AI models should be streamed or returned within a reasonable time frame, acknowledging that AI processing time is a factor.
    *   Local tool execution (e.g., shell commands) should be near-instantaneous.
*   **NFR1.2 Reliability**:
    *   The application should handle API errors gracefully (e.g., network issues, invalid API keys) and provide informative messages to the user.
    *   The application should be stable and not crash unexpectedly.
*   **NFR1.3 Usability**:
    *   The CLI should be intuitive and easy to learn.
    *   Error messages should be clear and actionable.
    *   Documentation (`README.md`, etc.) should be comprehensive.
*   **NFR1.4 Security**:
    *   API keys must be handled securely, not hardcoded, and primarily managed through environment variables or git-ignored `.env` files.
    *   Caution should be advised for executing shell commands, with potential future enhancements for user confirmation on sensitive operations.
*   **NFR1.5 Maintainability**:
    *   Code should be well-structured, modular, and follow defined coding standards (`CODING_STYLE.md`).
    *   Easy to debug and update.
*   **NFR1.6 Extensibility**:
    *   The architecture should allow for the addition of new AI model providers with minimal changes to the core system.
    *   The architecture should allow for the easy addition of new tools and capabilities.
*   **NFR1.7 Installation**:
    *   The installation process using `pip` and a virtual environment should be straightforward.
    *   Docker-based deployment should be supported and functional.

## 6. Future Considerations / Potential Roadmap

*   **FC1. Advanced Context Management**: More sophisticated session history and context management.
*   **FC2. Tool Discovery**: Mechanism for AI to discover available tools and their usage.
*   **FC3. User Confirmation for Sensitive Operations**: Implement a confirmation step before executing potentially destructive shell commands or creating/modifying cloud resources.
*   **FC4. Plugin Architecture for Tools**: A more formal plugin system for adding new tools.
*   **FC5. Support for More Cloud Providers**: Extend toolset to support other cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Azure).
*   **FC6. GUI Interface**: A web-based or desktop GUI as an alternative to the CLI.
*   **FC7. More Sophisticated GCP Tools**: Tools for managing other GCP resources (e.g., GCE instances, GCS buckets).
*   **FC8. Output Formatting**: Allow users to specify output formats for tool results (e.g., JSON, YAML, table).
*   **FC9. Logging and Auditing**: Enhanced logging for debugging and auditing user commands and AI interactions.
*   **FC10. Testing Framework**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests.
